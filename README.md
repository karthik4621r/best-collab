# best-collab

A sample collaboration tool which can be used for managing boards with a set of cards. Right now, it just has a few basic capabilities enabled:

1. A board with a set of columns which holds the cards
2. The cards are linked to a set of labels
3. We can search for the cards with labels, cards in a specific column etc.

Future enhancements
1. Performance improvements
2. Integration with ElasticSearch
3. Web app with endpoints to perform the operations on the board
4. So on............
